### Apple is run like a huge startup. The key to great products is small teams. ﻿

﻿One of my favorite and most-used [iPhone apps](http://gizmodo.com/tag/iphoneapps/) is Apple&#8217;s Remote app. It lets me remotely control iTunes, which is streaming to my living room stereo via an Airport Express. But why hasn&#8217;t it been updated in over 8 months?

一個我最喜歡、最常用的iPhone軟體是Apple的Remote App。他讓我遠端控制iTunes，讓它透過Airport Express串流音樂到我的客廳。但是為何它超過八個月沒更新了？

> Yes, the Remote app is due for an update. But here&#8217;s why it hasn&#8217;t been updated: the person who wrote it is busy working on other things. Yes, the person, not the team. (He&#8217;s a good friend of mine)
>
> 是的，Rempte app 已經到了更新的時候，但是以下就是它為何還沒更新的原因：寫它的人正在忙著其他工作。是的，是「人」而不是「團隊」。（它是我的一個好朋友。）
>
> Apple doesn&#8217;t build large teams to work on every product they make. Instead, they hire very few, but very intelligent people who can work on different projects and move around as needed.
>
> Apple並沒有為了每個產品建立一個大型團隊。相反地，他們聘請非常少，但是非常聰明的人，這些人有辦法進行各種不同的專案，並隨需要在各專案間移動。
>
> One day you might be working on the Remote app, and the next day you might get pulled on to another project that needs your help.
>
> 一天你可能正在忙著Remote app，隔天你可能被推去做另一個需要你幫助的專案。
>
> The engineers on the Mac OS and iOS teams move back and forth between the two projects based on release cycles and what&#8217;s needs to ship next.
>
> 雖著產品更新週期以及下次更新需要推出的功能，Mac OS團隊與 iOS團隊的工程師在兩個專案間不斷地調動。
>
> Even on Final Cut Pro, team members were sometimes asked to work on the other pro applications if they needed help to ship on time.
>
> 即使在Final Cut Pro，在其他專業軟體團隊需要幫助以便即時推出時，專案成員有時候會被要求到其他團隊幫忙。，
>
> An engineer at Apple can&#8217;t just assume they will be working on one project forever. And teams at Apple won&#8217;t grow to sizes beyond what is absolutely necessary.
>
> 在Apple工作的工程師不能認為他們會永遠在同一個專案裡工作。Apple內的團隊規模也不會成長到超出必要的最低限度。
>
> Startups also thrive by keeping things lean. Great startups have small teams that can build quickly and pivot when needed. When working at a startup, you don&#8217;t own just one part of the application: you have to be able to work on whatever needs your attention that day.
>
> 創新企業也是靠著維持精簡來蓬勃發展。偉大的創新企業都有一個小團隊可以快速的在需要時做出反應。在創新企業中工作時，你不會只有負責軟體的一部分，你必須要處理所有當天需要你注意的事情。
>
> Maybe that&#8217;s the problem at Microsoft: they think they can solve problems by throwing lots of people at them. They put together large teams to build products. And large teams require managers. The last thing we need in the world are more product managers.
>
> 也許那就是微軟的問題，他們覺得他們可以靠著在團隊內增加大量的人材來解決問題。他們組合許多大型團隊來建立產品，而大型團隊需要管理人材。在世界上我們最不需要的就是更多的產品經理。
