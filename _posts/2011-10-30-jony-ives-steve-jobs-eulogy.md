Apple工業設計資深副總裁Jonathan Ive，在2011年10月19日Apple公司內部舉辦的Steve Jobs紀念活動上，對所有Apple員工說出了他對Steve Jobs的感受&hellip;&hellip;

> Steve used to say to me (and he used to say this a lot), "Hey Jony, here's a dopey idea." And sometimes they were &mdash; really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But&nbsp;sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, were utterly profound.
>
> And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. I think he, better than anyone, understood that&nbsp;while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.
>
> I loved the way that he listened so intently. I loved his perception, his remarkable sensitivity, and his surgically precise opinion. I really believe there was a beauty in how singular, how keen his insight was, even though sometimes it could sting.
>
> As I'm sure many of you know, Steve didn't confine his sense of excellence to making products. When we travelled together, we would check in and I'd go up to my room. And I'd leave my bags very neatly by the door. And I wouldn't unpack. And I would go and sit on the bed. I would go and sit on the bed next to the phone. And I would wait for the inevitable phone call: "Hey Jony, this hotel sucks. Let's go."
>
> He used to joke that the lunatics had taken over the asylum, as we shared a giddy excitement spending months and months working on a part of a product that nobody would ever see. Not with their eyes. We did it because we really believed it was right because we cared.&nbsp;He believed that there was a gravity, almost a sense of civic responsibility, to care way beyond any sort of functional imperative.
>
> While the work hopefully appeared inevitable, appeared simple and easy, it really cost. It cost us all, didn't it? But you know what?&nbsp;It cost him most. He cared the most. He worried the most deeply. He constantly questioned, "Is this good enough? Is this right?" And despite all his successes, all his achievements, he never assumed that we would get there in the end. When the ideas didn't come, and when the prototypes failed, it was with with great intent, with faith, that he decided to believe we would eventually make something great.
>
> But the joy of getting there! I loved his enthusiasm, his simple delight (often, I think, mixed with some relief) that, yeah, we got there. We got there in the end and it was good. You can see his smile, can't you? The celebration of making something great for everybody, enjoying the defeat of cynicism, the rejection of reason, the rejection of being told a hundred times, "You can't do that."&nbsp;So his, I think, was a victory for beauty, for purity, and, as he would say, for giving a damn.
>
> He was my closest and my most loyal friend. We worked together for nearly fifteen years. (And he still laughed at the way I say "aluminium".)
>
> For the past two weeks, we've all been struggling to find ways to say goodbye. This morning I simply want to end by saying, "Thank you, Steve." Thank you for your remarkable vision, which has united and inspired this extraordinary group of people. For all that we have learned from you, and for all that we will continue to learn from each other:&nbsp;Thank you, Steve.

> Steve過去常常跟我說（而且說了N次）：「嘿！Jony，我有個蠢主意。」
>
> 有時，它們真的是蠢透了。而有時，那些主意真的很可怕。但是有時候，這些主意會讓房間變成真空，並讓我們完全陷入沉默。
>
> 這些想法也許是大膽、瘋狂、宏偉的。或是一個安靜、簡單、但是非常深奧的細節。
>
> 而正如同Steve對細節以及創作產品的熱愛，他對於創作的過程是罕見地、完全地崇敬。我想，他比任何人都了解一個最終能產生巨大力量的創意，都是由一個極其脆弱、幾乎無法成形的想法而來的。它們是如此輕易地會被錯過、被妥協、或是被擠壓。
>
> 我喜歡他那如此專注聆聽的方式。我喜歡他的洞察力、非凡的感性以及如外科手術般精準的建議。我真的相信，在他那不凡的眼光中，存在著一種美。儘管，有時候他的眼光很刺人。
>
> 我想你們許多人都知道，Steve並不只將他的對於卓越的感覺侷限在產品上。當我們一起去旅行時，我會先到櫃檯簽到，並進到房間裡。不過我不會打開行李，而是坐在床上，電話的旁邊，等著那通絕對會來的電話說：「嘿！Jony，這間旅館爛透了，我們走吧！」
>
> 在我們一起瘋狂地花上一個又一個月的時間，做著產品中沒有人會看見的部分時，他會開玩笑地說這就像是精神病患接管了療養院一樣。我們會如此在意這些沒人看到的小地方，是因為我們關心，並且相信這是正確的事。他相信那就如同重力，幾乎就像是公民的責任一般，去關心那些遠超過功能需求的東西。
>
> 雖然就結果來看，作品似乎都很簡單、容易，但是這真的犧牲了很多東西。我們都為此而犧牲了些東西，不是嗎？但是，他犧牲了最多，他同時也是最關心作品的人。他不斷地質疑：「這已經夠好了嗎？我們真的做對了嗎？」
>
> 儘管已經有了這一切的成就，他從不認為我們最終有一天會到達那個目標。而當靈感還沒有出現、製作的原型失敗時，他仍然保有偉大的意圖與信念，並決定相信我們最終會創作出偉大的作品來。
>
> 而所有的喜悅，就在這一切達成時出現！我喜歡他的熱情、他那單純的快樂（通常，我想這也混合著一些解脫）。是啊！我們已經到到目的地了！我們最後還是到達了目的地，而且成果也很棒。在那時，你可以看到他的微笑，不是嗎？
>
> 慶祝我們為了大家做出了偉大的東西，享受著擊敗那些冷嘲熱諷、那些被退回的理由、那些被說了上百次的「你做不到！」。
>
> 所以，我認為這是一場為了美、為了純粹的勝利。而他總是會說，這無關緊要。

> 他是我最親近、最忠誠的朋友。我們一起工作了近十五年。而且，他還是會笑我說「aluminium」時的口音。
>
> 在過去的兩個星期，我們都在掙扎著找出道別的方式。而在今天早上，我只想簡單的說：「謝了，Steve。」
>
> 謝謝你那非凡的願景，團結並激勵了這群非凡的人。對所有從你身上所學到的，以及今後我們將繼續從彼此間學習到的，我要說聲：「謝謝你，Steve。」
