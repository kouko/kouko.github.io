在不久之前，New York Times發表了一篇長篇報導「[In China, Human Costs Are Built Into an iPad](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html?_r=2&hpw=&pagewanted=all)」，敘述了Apple供應鏈中供應商嚴苛的工作條件以及種種詳細情形。其中也包含去年富士康成都工廠的爆炸事件，以及Apple對種種違規狀況視而不見的情形。


對此，Apple CEO Tim Cook發出了一封有點長的信件給Apple全體員工，作為此報導的直接回應。信件全文如下&hellip;&hellip;

> 團隊們，
>
> 作為公司以及個人，我們是由我們的價值觀所定義的。不幸的是，現在有些人正在質疑著Apple的價值觀，我想要與你們直接地討論這個問題。我們關心在我們全球供應鏈中的每一位工人。任何事故都會令人深感不安，任何關於工作環境的問題也會引起人們的關注。而我們唯一不關心的，就是錯誤並且令人不快的訊息。正如你們比其他人還深知的，如此這般的指控顯然已經違背了我們的價值觀，這並不是真正的我們。
>
> 對於數百位正在我們世界各地的供應商駐點，或是花費了漫長的路途並遠離家庭的人，我知道你與我一樣由於這份報導而感到憤慨。對於並不熟知供應鏈的人們來說，您有權知道事實。
>
> 每年，我們檢查了更多的工廠，為了我們的合作夥伴更進一步地提高標準，並且更加地深入供應鏈。正如我們在本月初所發表的報告，我們已經取得了非常大的進步，並且改善了數以萬計工人的勞動條件。我們知道，在我們的產業中沒有其他人像我們一樣如此地努力，到了那麼多的地方，並與如此多的人們接觸。
>
> 與此同時，也沒有人像我們一樣面臨著如此巨大的挑戰。我們在全球最主要的安全、環境與公平勞動相關團體的協助下，積極地解決各種問題。從少數的現場與漂亮的書面報告中尋找問題非常簡單，但是這樣並不會成為一個領導者該有的行動。
>
> 在本月初，我們為了由公平勞工協會所主持的獨立評估，敞開了我們的供應鏈。Apple的獨特地位，可以由此一動作來領導整個產業，而我們對此也毫不猶豫。這也會讓我們的供應鏈有更經常性、更透明化的報告，我們也非常樂意如此。這些舉動，也是Apple的顧客們所期望的，我們在未來也會採取更多此類的行動。
>
> 我們致力於教育工人了解自己的權利，在他們看到不安全的工作條件或是不公平的待遇時，他們也有權大聲地發言。如同大家所之，超過一百萬人已經由我們的計畫接受了訓練。
>
> 我們將持續地深入，並且必然會發現更多的問題。而我們從不，未來也不會做的，就是停下來或是對我們供應鏈中的問題視而不見。在這點上，我對此做出承諾。各位可以在&nbsp;[apple.com/supplierresponsibility](http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/) 中了解我們的計畫。
>
> 對於Apple內每天在解決這些問題的人們，在此獻上我們的欽佩與感謝。你們的工作非常地有意義，並且改變了人們的生活。我們都非常自豪能與你們一同工作。
>

> Team,

> As a company and as individuals, we are defined by our values. Unfortunately some people are questioning Apple's values today, and I'd like to address this with you directly. We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain. Any accident is deeply troubling, and any issue with working conditions is cause for concern. Any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us. As you know better than anyone, accusations like these are contrary to our values. It's not who we are.
>
> For the many hundreds of you who are based at our suppliers' manufacturing sites around the world, or spend long stretches working there away from your families, I know you are as outraged by this as I am. For the people who aren't as close to the supply chain, you have a right to know the facts.
>
> Every year we inspect more factories, raising the bar for our partners and going deeper into the supply chain. As we reported earlier this month, we've made a great deal of progress and improved conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers. We know of no one in our industry doing as much as we are, in as many places, touching as many people.
>
> At the same time, no one has been more up front about the challenges we face. We are attacking problems aggressively with the help of the world's foremost authorities on safety, the environment, and fair labor. It would be easy to look for problems in fewer places and report prettier results, but those would not be the actions of a leader.
>
> Earlier this month we opened our supply chain for independent evaluations by the Fair Labor Association. Apple was in a unique position to lead the industry by taking this step, and we did it without hesitation. This will lead to more frequent and more transparent reporting on our supply chain, which we welcome. These are the kinds of actions our customers expect from Apple, and we will take more of them in the future.
>
> We are focused on educating workers about their rights, so they are empowered to speak up when they see unsafe conditions or unfair treatment. As you know, more than a million people have been trained by our program.
>
> We will continue to dig deeper, and we will undoubtedly find more issues. What we will not do &mdash; and never have done &mdash; is stand still or turn a blind eye to problems in our supply chain. On this you have my word. You can follow our progress at [apple.com/supplierresponsibility](http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/).
>
> To those within Apple who are tackling these issues every day, you have our thanks and admiration. Your work is significant and it is changing people's lives. We are all proud to work alongside you.
>
> Tim
