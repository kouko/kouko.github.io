以下是從Quora上，由兩位前Apple員工所述的Apple的企業文化與公司內部的情形，以及AppleInsiter上的一些其他細節。照慣例翻譯的水準不怎麼樣，所以有心人還是請直接看原文...Orz

### Corporate Culture 企業文化
> Apple is a pretty divided mix of typical corporate red tape and politics mixed in with startup level urgency when the direction comes from Steve. If you have a project that Steve is not involved in, it will take months of meetings to move things forward. If Steve wants it done, it&#8217;s done faster than anyone thinks is humanly possible. The best way to get any cross departmental work done was to say its for Steve and you&#8217;d probably have it the same day.&nbsp;
>
> Apple的企業文化是兩種非常歧異的混和ー傳統企業的繁文縟節政治，以及當命令來自Steve時的十萬火急全力衝刺。如果你有個專案是Steve沒有參與的，它將會花費數月的會議來讓進度前進。如果Steve想要事情完成，專案將會以非人類的速度搞定。讓任何跨部門的工作完成最好的方法是說這是Steve要的東西，然後你要的東西十之八九會在當天完成。

### Launch Events 發表會
> Probably the single greatest feeling working at Apple is getting to work on part of the product launch process. You plan and prep for months, then launch week you work like mad for 12-16 hours days and even pull all nighters to make sure your piece of the puzzle is ready for Apple&#8217;s big presentation. Then you gather with all the other employees in the cafe and watch it all unfold. It&#8217;s a great rush and your whole team feels it.&nbsp;
>
> 也許讓人有在Apple工作最強烈感受的時候是在產品發表時的過程。你花了數個月來計畫﻿與演練，在發表當週你像瘋子一樣一天工作十二到十六小時，甚至整晚熬夜來保證你負責的那塊拼圖已經為了Apple的發表會準備妥當。然後與其他所有員工一起聚在咖啡廳內觀看產品發表會。那會是無比的衝擊，而且你與整個團隊將會一起感受它。

### Worker Mentality 員工心態
> Apple is one of those companies where people work on an almost religious level of commitment. There are probably a handful of large companies that can command this, such as Disney or Google. Most workers, no matter how simple their job might be, truly feel they are changing the world with whatever they are doing. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, it can just make you blind on the next point:&nbsp;
>
> Apple是那種人們工作幾乎像是宗教般地奉獻的公司，大概是少數可以如此的大型公司，就像是Disney或是Google。大部分的員工，無論他們的工作是多麼簡單，都真的相信他們的工作可以改變這個世界。這不是壞事，這可以讓你忽略下一段。



### Company Benefits 公司福利
>Pretty lacking here, in my opinion. The cafe costs, and isn&#8217;t really that cheap (although PB&J will run you 25 cents). Every floor has a vending machine, which also cost (though the ice cream machines were pretty slick) and even the refrigerator in the Graphic Design department had an &#8216;honor bar&#8217; that you had to pay for yogurt and other items. The gym also isn&#8217;t free, but is on campus and decent. I recall one person asked Steve why these benefits were so low, and the main response was &#8220;it&#8217;s my job to make your stock go up so you can afford these things".&nbsp;
>
> 就我的觀點來看，非常的缺乏。公司內的咖啡廳是要付費的，而且不是真的很便宜（雖然 PB&J三明治要花掉你25分）。每層樓都有自動販賣機，同樣也是要錢的。（雖然冰淇淋機很漂亮）而且甚至在圖像設計部門的冰箱有個「榮譽欄」來記錄你要付多少錢在優格與其他東西上。健身房同樣也不是免費，但是是在園區內而且還不錯。我記得有個人問Steve為什麼福利那麼低，而得到的回應主要是「我的工作是讓你的股票（注：因該是指Apple的股票）上漲，讓你可以買的起這些東西。」

### Perks 額外獎賞
> Modest perks include one computer system at 25% off per year, with 3 15% discounts for friends and family. On campus store includes the only Apple swag you&#8217;ll probably ever see, and all software there is 50% off.&nbsp;
>
> 小小的額外獎賞包含一年可以用25% OFF 的折扣購買一台電腦，加上3台15% OFF的折扣給朋友與家人。在園區商店，包含唯一的蘋果禮品店內的所有軟體折扣 50%。

### Security 保安
> Security is (was? things seem to have changed a bit since i left&#8230;nothing like the the 4G engineer mishap and the caltrain mishap before that occurred during my time there) Apple&#8217;s culture. It wasn&#8217;t just the rules, it was the job itself. The measures that Apple takes to protect its creative and intellectual environment are unparalleled in the valley, and it&#8217;s been a disappointing experience since leaving there. Apple&#8217;s security policy extends to blogs, to speaking engagements, to what we talk about with our spouses. Most people get it and respect it. The ones who don&#8217;t &#8212; the ones who need to put Apple under their name so they can get a speaking gig at SxSW &#8212; are kindly ushered to move on.&nbsp;
>
> 保安是Apple的文化。它不只是規定，它就是工作本身。Apple為了保護它的創意與智慧的環境所採取的措施，在矽谷是前所未有的。而且自從離開之後，那是非常令人失望的經驗。Apple的保安政策包含部落格，以及與配偶的交談內容。大部分的人了解並尊重這點。那些不了解並尊重這點，將Apple的招牌掛在他們的名下，讓自己可以在SxSW上大聲說話的人，將會被踢出公司。
>
> If I was still at Apple, I would not be responding to this question, nor would I feel wronged for not being able to. (Honestly I&#8217;m surprised that an iTunes engineer commented about the iTunes Genius system in another question, that&#8217;s a slap on the wrist there).&nbsp;
>
> 如果我還在Apple，我不會回答這個問題，也不會因為無法回答而感到委屈。（老實說我很驚訝iTunes的工程師會在其他問題中對iTunes Genius系統做出評論，那可算是輕度的罪行。）
> The general idea is this: You are part of something much bigger than you. &nbsp;The ideas you talk about in the hall, the neat tricks you figured out in CSS, the new unibody machining technique, that&#8217;s part of your job, something you are paid to do for Apple&#8217;s success, not something you need to blog about to satisfy your ego. Don&#8217;t fuck it up for everyone.&nbsp;
>
> 大致上的概念是這樣：你是比自己更大的事物的一部分。你在大廳裡所談論的想法、你發現的CSS簡潔技巧，新的unibody機械技術，那是你工作的一部分，是領了薪水的你為了Apple的成功的付出，並不是用來寫在blog上滿足自尊的東西。別搞砸了大家。
> But since the question is about culture, it&#8217;s important to grasp that it&#8217;s exciting to be part of this. Knowing that that codename you know isn&#8217;t the same codename someone else knows, designed to see who slips up and leaks. Knowing that that thing you&#8217;re working on might not be what you think it is at all, only the relevant details of your interaction with it and work on it are what matter. It creates such a huge amount of respect for what the company is doing, internally, and I think people feel good about participating in it.&nbsp;
>
> 但由於這個問題是關於文化，重要的是掌握住成為這一份子的興奮。明白你知道的代號與其他人知道的並不是相同的。知道你正在工作的部分可能根本不是你所想的，重要的只有與你相關和正在負責的相關細節。這對這間公司的作為與內在本質﻿創造了極大的尊重。
>
> Lastly, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that one can only say so much about Apple&#8217;s security, even as an ex-employee, both out of respect and contractual obligation&#8230;&nbsp;
>
> 最後，值得一提的是，可以說出那麼多與Apple保安相關的人，甚至作為一個前雇員，還是出於尊重與契約責任&#8230;
> I mention this all because everyone on here has watched a coworker tweet a company secret, a VP leak it to the press, someone pull out a prototype in a restaurant to show off&#8230;that just does not happen.&nbsp;
>
> 我提到這些是因為這裡的每個人都看到同事在細談公司秘密，VP洩漏秘密給媒體，某人將原型帶到餐廳炫耀&#8230;那就是不會發生。
>
> One employee said that employees working on secret projects at Apple must &#8220;pass through a maze of security doors, swiping their badges again and again and finally entering a numeric code to reach their offices." Once inside the top-secret areas, employees are often monitored by surveillance cameras as they work. Those working with the most sensitive projects are allegedly instructed to &#8220;cover up devices with black cloaks when they are working on them, and turn on a red warning light when devices are unmasked so that everyone knows to be extra-careful."&nbsp;
>
> 一位員工敘述，正在進行秘密計畫的員工在Apple內需要「穿過宛如迷宮般的安全門，一次又一次的刷員工卡，最後輸入密碼來進入他們的辦公室。」一旦進入最高機密的區域，員工工作時大部分都會被監視器監視。那些在最敏感項目工作的人，據說被命令要「在工作時要用黑布蓋住產品，當黑布被取下時，紅色警示燈會亮起提醒大家要格外小心」。
>
> And in January, a former Apple marketing manager described the company&#8217;s &#8220;controlled leaks," which he said the company sometimes relies upon to gauge public reaction, confuse competitors or encourage partners.&nbsp;
>
> 在一月，一位前Apple行銷經理解釋公司的「控制洩密」，有時公司會依此來判斷大眾反應、迷惑競爭對手或是激勵合作夥伴。
